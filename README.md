# YOLOv7-object-detection-Traffic-light-detection
Based on https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7/tree/u7

Convert the json file to a separate txt file, that is, the format required by YOLO:
jsontotxt.py

Convert the json file to a txt file containing the entire dataset:
jsontotxt.py

In this experiment, only the traffic light color is detected, so the light.yaml nc is 3.
